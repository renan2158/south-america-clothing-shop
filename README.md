### :page_with_curl: About

The South America Clothing Shop is a fictituous company, it's an e-commerce who plans to sell clothes all over the world.

### :memo: The project

The initial idea was just create a very simple e-commerce, in a way that the user can add an item or a set or items to the cart. After that, the platform will process the purchase and show a sucess message to the user.

After doing that, I had some ideas of possible features to be implemented in the future. And I'd like to continue upgrading this project as much as I can.
